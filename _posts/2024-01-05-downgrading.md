# Why can't I downgrade?
So, why can't you downgrade games on by downloading them directly right now?
Oculus removed download permission for the internal type of account I sign you in with. This means none of my downgrading tools currently have permission to download games from Oculus side

## Info on accounts
Even if you login with the same email and password, depending on the website you sign into, your logged in account has different permissions. For example when you log in on the developer page your logged in account does not have permission to download games. And neither does your account do on any other oculus webpage I'm aware of.

## What this means
You cannot download games anymore by simply signing into your browser or current downgrading tools

# How can I currently downgrade?
## Quest (recommended)
The **currently recommended** way to downgrade is to install [QuestAppVersionSwitcher](https://sidequestvr.com/app/5333/) to your quest via [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto). You can then either follow the provided instructions (in app) to downgrade and mod Beat Saber.
Bear in mind that sadly only Beat Saber can currently be downgraded. And that only to some specific versions. QAVS will tell you which versions you can downgrade to.

## PCVR
As this also affects PCVR downgrading you cannot downgrade any games on PC.

# Conclusion
I hope this clears things up. If you have any further questions feel free to join the [OculusDB Discord server](https://discord.gg/zwRfHQN2UY) and ask your questions there.
I'm searching for ways to get downloads working again. However it may take quite a bit till I find something if I find something at all.
