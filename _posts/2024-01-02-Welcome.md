# Welcome to my Blog!
This is the first blog entry to check if GitHub pages works.

## What's this blog about?
This blog is about development of my tools. I'll use it as central resource for announcements instead of just positing them on Discord. Then it's all in a central place, can be linked and updated with new information.
Blog posts will occasionally redirect to more up to date posts
