# What's this?
A list of shit I could build or not

- [ ] a second thumb on the opposite side of your hand from your real thumb, attach it in such a way that the fake thumb mimics your real thumb's movements (Knuckledf)
- [ ] hammerhead shark robot that wiggles around and makes an uwu face if it detects something touching its head (Knuckledf)
- [ ] a small ceiling fan with smaller ceiling fans at the end of each blade (Knuckledf)
- [ ] Buld a gaming chair for a flight simulator. If you eject yourself from the plane, the chair ejects you
